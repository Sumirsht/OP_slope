# OP_slope

This repository contains a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script to generate a **slope map** in degrees for forest management planning in Nepal. The workflow follows the standard methodology outlined in Nepal’s **Operational Forest Management Plan (OP)**, which is widely used by the Department of Forests for forest zoning, regeneration assessment, and sustainable harvesting planning.

## ▶️ How to Run the Script

1. Go to [Google Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com)
2. Open or paste the script from `slopemap_OP.js`
3. Replace the region shapefile (if needed) with your `ee.FeatureCollection`
4. Run the script to visualize the slope
5. Export the raster using the `Export.image.toDrive()` function

📁 Follow this repository for updates, contributions, or to adapt the script for your own forest biometric studies.
